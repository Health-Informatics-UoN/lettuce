### `OMOPMatcher`
```python
class OMOPMatcher(
	logger: Logger
)
```

This class retrieves matches from an OMOP database and returns the best
#### Methods

##### `__init__`
```python
def __init__(
	logger: Logger
)
```

##### `close`
```python
def close()
```

Close the engine connection.

##### `calculate_best_matches`
```python
def calculate_best_matches(
	search_terms: str[List]
	vocabulary_id: 
	concept_ancestor: bool
	concept_relationship: bool
	concept_synonym: bool
	search_threshold: int
	max_separation_descendant: int
	max_separation_ancestor: int
)
```

Calculate best OMOP matches for given search terms

Calls fetch_OMOP_concepts on every item in search_terms.

###### Parameters
`search_terms: List[str]`
A list of queries to send to the OMOP database

`vocabulary_id: str`
An OMOP vocabulary_id to pass to the OMOP query to restrict the concepts received to a specific vocabulary

`concept_ancestor: bool`
If true, then calls fetch_concept_ancestor()

`concept_relationship: bool`
If true, then calls fetch_concept_relationship()

`concept_synonym: bool`
If true, then queries the synonym table of the OMOP database for matches to the search terms

`search_threshold: int`
The threshold on fuzzy string matching for returned results

`max_separation_descendant: int`
The maximum separation to search for concept descendants

`max_separation_ancestor: int`
The maximum separation to search for concept ancestors

###### Returns
`list`
A list of results for the search terms run with the other parameters provided.



##### `fetch_OMOP_concepts`
```python
def fetch_OMOP_concepts(
	search_term: str
	vocabulary_id: 
	concept_ancestor: bool
	concept_relationship: bool
	concept_synonym: bool
	search_threshold: int
	max_separation_descendant: int
	max_separation_ancestor: int
)
```

Fetch OMOP concepts for a given search term

Runs queries against the OMOP database
If concept_synonym is false, then a query is run that queries the concept table alone. If concept_synonym is true, then this search is expanded to the concept_synonym table.

Any concepts returned by the query are then filtered by fuzzy string matching. Any concepts satisfying the concept threshold are returned.

If the concept_ancestor and concept_relationship arguments are true, the relevant methods are called on these concepts and the result added to the output.

###### Parameters
`search_term: str`
A search term for a concept inserted into a query to the OMOP database

`vocabulary_id: list[str]`
A list of OMOP vocabularies to filter the findings by

`concept_ancestor: str`
If true then appends the results of a call to fetch_concept_ancestor to the output

`concept_relationship: str`
If true then appends the result of a call to fetch_concept_relationship to the output

`concept_synonym: str`
If true, checks the concept_synonym table for the search term

`search_threshold: int`
The threshold on fuzzy string matching for returned results

`max_separation_descendant: int`
The maximum separation to search for concept descendants

`max_separation_ancestor: int`
The maximum separation to search for concept ancestors

###### Returns
`list | None`
A list of search results from the OMOP database if the query comes back with results, otherwise returns None

##### `fetch_concept_ancestor`
```python
def fetch_concept_ancestor(
	concept_id: str
	max_separation_descendant: int
	max_separation_ancestor: int
)
```

Fetch concept ancestor for a given concept_id

Queries the OMOP database's ancestor table to find ancestors for the concept_id provided within the constraints of the degrees of separation provided.

###### Parameters
`concept_id: str`
The concept_id used to find ancestors

`max_separation_descendant: int`
The maximum level of separation allowed between descendant concepts and the provided concept

`max_separation_ancestor: int`
The maximum level of separation allowed between ancestor concepts and the provided concept

###### Returns
`list`
A list of retrieved concepts and their relationships to the provided concept_id

##### `fetch_concept_relationship`
```python
def fetch_concept_relationship(
	concept_id: 
)
```

Fetch concept relationship for a given concept_id

Queries the concept_relationship table of the OMOP database to find the relationship between concepts

###### Parameters
`concept_id: str`
An id for a concept provided to the query for finding concept relationships

###### Returns
`list`
A list of related concepts from the OMOP database


### `run`
```python
def run(
	search_term: list[str]
	logger: Logger
	vocabulary_id: list[str]
	search_threshold: int
	concept_ancestor: bool
	concept_relationship: bool
	concept_synonym: bool
	max_separation_descendant: int
	max_separation_ancestor: int
)
```

Runs queries against the OMOP database

Loads the query options from BaseOptions, then uses these to select which queries to run.

#### Parameters
`vocabulary_id: list[str]`
A list of vocabularies to use for search

`concept_ancestor: bool`
Whether to return ancestor concepts in the result

`concept_relationship: bool`
Whether to return related concepts in the result

`concept_synonym: bool`
Whether to explore concept synonyms in the result

`search_threshold: int`
The fuzzy match threshold for results

`max_separation_descendant: int`
The maximum separation between a base concept and its descendants

`max_separation_ancestor: int`
The maximum separation between a base concept and its ancestors

`search_term: str`
The name of a drug to use in queries to the OMOP database

`logger: Logger`
A logger for logging runs of the tool

#### Returns
`list`
A list of OMOP concepts relating to the search term and relevant information
