### `OMOPMatcher`
```
class OMOPMatcher(
	self: 

	logger: Logger

)
```

This class retrieves matches from an OMOP database and returns the best
### Methods

#### `__init__`
```
method __init__(
	self: 

	logger: Logger

)
```



#### `close`
```
method close(
	self: 

)
```

Close the engine connection.

#### `calculate_best_matches`
```
method calculate_best_matches(
	self: 

	search_terms: str[List]

	vocabulary_id: 

	concept_ancestor: bool

	concept_relationship: bool

	concept_synonym: bool

	search_threshold: int

	max_separation_descendant: int

	max_separation_ancestor: int

)
```

Calculate best OMOP matches for given search terms

Calls fetch_OMOP_concepts on every item in search_terms.

##### Parameters
search_terms: List[str]

A list of queries to send to the OMOP database

vocabulary_id: str

An OMOP vocabulary_id to pass to the OMOP query to restrict the concepts received to a specific vocabulary

concept_ancestor: bool

If 'y', then calls fetch_concept_ancestor()

concept_relationship: bool

If 'y', then calls fetch_concept_relationship()

concept_synonym: bool

If 'y', then queries the synonym table of the OMOP database for matches to the search terms

search_threshold: int

The threshold on fuzzy string matching for returned results

max_separation_descendant: int

The maximum separation to search for concept descendants

max_separation_ancestor: int

The maximum separation to search for concept ancestors

##### Returns
list

A list of results for the search terms run with the other parameters provided.



#### `fetch_OMOP_concepts`
```
method fetch_OMOP_concepts(
	self: 

	search_term: str

	vocabulary_id: 

	concept_ancestor: bool

	concept_relationship: bool

	concept_synonym: bool

	search_threshold: int

	max_separation_descendant: int

	max_separation_ancestor: int

)
```

Fetch OMOP concepts for a given search term

Runs queries against the OMOP database
If concept_synonym != 'y', then a query is run that queries the concept table alone. If concept_synonym == 'y', then this search is expanded to the concept_synonym table.

Any concepts returned by the query are then filtered by fuzzy string matching. Any concepts satisfying the concept threshold are returned.

If the concept_ancestor and concept_relationship arguments are 'y', the relevant methods are called on these concepts and the result added to the output.

##### Parameters
search_term: str

A search term for a concept inserted into a query to the OMOP database

vocabulary_id: list[str]

A list of OMOP vocabularies to filter the findings by

concept_ancestor: str

If 'y' then appends the results of a call to fetch_concept_ancestor to the output

concept_relationship: str

If 'y' then appends the result of a call to fetch_concept_relationship to the output

concept_synonym: str

If 'y', checks the concept_synonym table for the search term

search_threshold: int

The threshold on fuzzy string matching for returned results

max_separation_descendant: int

The maximum separation to search for concept descendants

max_separation_ancestor: int

The maximum separation to search for concept ancestors

##### Returns
list | None

A list of search results from the OMOP database if the query comes back with results, otherwise returns None



#### `fetch_concept_ancestor`
```
method fetch_concept_ancestor(
	self: 

	concept_id: str

	max_separation_descendant: int

	max_separation_ancestor: int

)
```

Fetch concept ancestor for a given concept_id

Queries the OMOP database's ancestor table to find ancestors for the concept_id provided within the constraints of the degrees of separation provided.

##### Parameters
concept_id: str

The concept_id used to find ancestors

max_separation_descendant: int

The maximum level of separation allowed between descendant concepts and the provided concept

max_separation_ancestor: int

The maximum level of separation allowed between ancestor concepts and the provided concept

##### Returns
list

A list of retrieved concepts and their relationships to the provided concept_id



#### `fetch_concept_relationship`
```
method fetch_concept_relationship(
	self: 

	concept_id: 

)
```

Fetch concept relationship for a given concept_id

Queries the concept_relationship table of the OMOP database to find the relationship between concepts

##### Parameters
concept_id: str

An id for a concept provided to the query for finding concept relationships

##### Returns
list

A list of related concepts from the OMOP database


### `run`
```
def run(
	search_term: str[List]

	logger: Logger

	vocabulary_id: str[list]

	search_threshold: int

	concept_ancestor: bool

	concept_relationship: bool

	concept_synonym: bool

	max_separation_descendant: int

	max_separation_ancestor: int

)
```

Runs queries against the OMOP database

Loads the query options from BaseOptions, then uses these to select which queries to run.

#### Parameters
vocabulary_id: list[str]

A list of vocabularies to use for search

concept_ancestor: bool

Whether to return ancestor concepts in the result

concept_relationship: bool

Whether to return related concepts in the result

concept_synonym: bool

Whether to explore concept synonyms in the result

search_threshold: int

The fuzzy match threshold for results

max_separation_descendant: int

The maximum separation between a base concept and its descendants

max_separation_ancestor: int

The maximum separation between a base concept and its ancestors

search_term: str

The name of a drug to use in queries to the OMOP database

logger: Logger

A logger for logging runs of the tool

#### Returns
list

A list of OMOP concepts relating to the search term and relevant information
