# `omop.omop_match`
The `omop_match` file provides functionality to match informal drug names and terms against standard concepts in a given set of OMOP Common Data Model vocabularies. It performs fuzzy matching to find the most relevant OMOP concepts and can optionally retrieve related concepts, ancestors, descendants, and synonyms.

## `OMOPMatcher`
This class retrieves matches from an OMOP database and returns the best matching concepts based on fuzzy string matching.
```python
class OMOPMatcher(
	logger: Logger, 
	vocabulary_id: list[str],
	search_threshold: int = 80,
	concept_ancestor: bool = False,
	concept_relationship: bool = False,
	concept_synonym: bool = False,
	standard_concept: bool = False, 
	max_separation_descendant: int = 1,
	max_separation_ancestor: int = 1
)
```
### Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `logger` | `Logger` | *required* | Logging object for capturing events and errors |
| `vocabulary_id` | `list[str]` | *required* | A list of vocabularies to use for search (e.g., ['RxNorm', 'SNOMED']) |
| `search_threshold` | `int` | `80` | The fuzzy match threshold for results (0-100) |
| `concept_ancestor` | `bool` | `False` | Whether to return ancestor concepts in the result |
| `concept_relationship` | `bool` | `False` | Whether to return related concepts in the result |
| `concept_synonym` | `bool` | `False` | Whether to explore concept synonyms in the result |
| `standard_concept` | `bool` | `False` | Whether to restrict results to standard concepts |
| `max_separation_descendant` | `int` | `1` | The maximum separation between a base concept and its descendants |
| `max_separation_ancestor` | `int` | `1` | The maximum separation between a base concept and its ancestors |

### `run`
```python
def run(
	search_terms: List[str]
)
```
The main method for processing drug name searches. It runs OMOP database queries for each provided search term and performs fuzzy pattern matching to select the best concept matches.

#### Parameters 
- `search_terms`: List of drug names or terms to search for 

#### Returns 
- A list of dictionaries, each containing: 
	- `search_term`: The original search term
	- `CONCEPT`: List of matching OMOP concepts with their details 


### `fetch_omop_concepts`
```python
def fetch_omop_concepts(
	search_term: str
) -> list | None:
```
Fetches OMOP concepts for a given search term by querying the OMOP database.

This functions builds a full-text query  using `omop.queries.text_search_query` to the OMOP database. 

A similarity score is then applied to the concept name strings returned from this search and the results filtered according to whether the scores are above the user-defined threshold `search_threshold`. 

#### Parameters 
- `search_term`: A search term to full-text query the OMOP database with

#### Returns 
- A list of matching concepts with their details, or `None` if no matches are found


### `calculate_similarity_score`
```python
@staticmethod 
def calculate_similarity_score(
	concept_name: str, 
	search_term: str
)
```
Static method that calculates a fuzzy similarity score between a concept name and a search term.  

Uses the Levenshtein ratio from the `rapidfuzz` library, which measures the edit distance between two strings. 
This returns a normalized score between 0 and 100, where:
  - 100 indicates identical strings (perfect match)
  - 0 indicates completely different strings (no similarity)
  - Values in between represent partial matches, with higher scores indicating greater similarity

This function also performs a simple pre-processing step whereby content from inside parentheses is removed from concept names. Case insensitive matching is then performed. 

#### Parameters 
- `concept-name`: The OMOP concept name to compare 
- `search_term`: THe user-entered term to compare against

#### Returns 

### `fetch_concept_ancestors_and_descendants`
```python
def fetch_concept_ancestor(
	concept_id: str
) -> List
```

Retrieves ancestor and descendant concepts for a given concept ID.

Queries the OMOP database's ancestor table to find ancestors for the concept_id provided within the constraints of the degrees of separation provided.

Executes the query `omop.omop_queries.query_ancestors_and_descendants_by_id`. 

#### Parameters
`concept_id: str`
The concept_id used to find ancestors

#### Returns
`list`
A list of concepts related hierarchically to the provided concept ID, including their relationship details

### `fetch_concept_relationship`
```python
def fetch_concept_relationship(
	concept_id: 
) -> List 
```

Fetch concept relationship for a given concept_id

Queries the concept_relationship table of the OMOP database to find the relationship between concepts

#### Parameters
`concept_id: str`
An id for a concept provided to the query for finding concept relationships

#### Returns
`list`
A list of related concepts from the OMOP database

### Response Structure 
The `run` method returns a list of dictionaries with the following structure: 
```json
