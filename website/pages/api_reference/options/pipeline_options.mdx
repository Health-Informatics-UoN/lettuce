### `LLMModel`
```
class LLMModel(
)
```

This enum holds the names of the different models the assistant can use
### `PipelineOptions`
```
class PipelineOptions(
)
```

This class holds the options available to the
Llettuce pipeline.

These are all the options in the BaseOptions parser.
The defaults provided here match the default options in
BaseOptions. Using a pydantic model means FastAPI
can take these as input in the API request.
