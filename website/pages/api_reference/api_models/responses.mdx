# `responses`
These classes are Pydantic models for the response format for the suggestions API.
The main class is `ConceptSuggestionResponse`, composed of a list of `Suggestion`s, and `SuggestionsMetaData` describing the pipeline.

## `Suggestion`

```python
class Suggestion(BaseModel):
    concept_name: str
    concept_id: int
    domain_id: str
    vocabulary_id: str
    concept_class_id: str
    standard_concept: Optional[str]
    invalid_reason: Optional[str]
    ranks: Optional[Dict[str, int]]
    scores: Optional[Dict[str, float]]
```

A model describing a single suggestion from a lettuce search.
Most of the fields are OMOP concept table fields, but ranks and scores describe how well the suggestions match the request.

### Attributes

| Fields | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| concept_name | str | The concept_name field from the OMOP concept table |
| concept_id | int | The concept_id field from the OMOP concept table |
| domain_id | str | The domain_id field from the OMOP concept table |
| vocabulary_id | str | The vocabulary_id field from the OMOP concept table |
| concept_class_id | str | The concept_class_id field from the OMOP concept table |
| standard_concept | Optional[str] | The standard_concept field from the OMOP concept table. The field is nullable, so is `Optional` |
| invalid_reason | Optional[str] | The invalid_reason field from the OMOP concept table. The field is nullable, so is `Optional` |
| ranks | Optional[Dict[str, int]] | The ranks of the suggestion, as determined by some algorithm used. The keys of the dict describe the algorithms, the values are the rank. |
| score | Optional[Dict[str, int]] | The scores of the suggestion, as determined by some algorithm used. The keys of the dict describe the algorithms, the values are the score. |


## `SuggestionsMetaData`

```python
class SuggestionsMetaData(BaseModel):
    assistant: str = "Lettuce"
    version: str = "0.1.0"
    pipeline: Optional[str] = None
```

A model describing the process used to get suggestions from a lettuce search.
The fields are general so that if applications use lettuce and other assistants, the provenance can be tracked.

### Attributes

| Fields | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| assistant | str | A description of the assistant used to make the suggestions. Defaults to "Lettuce" for obvious reasons |
| version | str | The version of the application used to make the suggestions. There's probably a clever way of reading the version at run time |
| pipeline | Optional[str] | A description of the pipeline within the application used to suggest concepts |

## `ConceptSuggestionResponse`

```python
class ConceptSuggestionResponse(BaseModel):
    recommendations: List[Suggestion]
    metadata: SuggestionsMetaData = Field(default_factory=SuggestionsMetaData)
```

A model to bundle `Suggestion`s and their associated `SuggestionsMetaData` into a single response.

### Attributes

| Fields | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| recommendations | List[Suggestion] | A list of `Suggestion`s made by lettuce |
| metadata | SuggestionsMetaData | A description of the process used to generate suggestions |
