## app
[source](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/lettuce/tree/main/Lettuce/app.py)

The `api.py` script starts a Lettuce server. Instructions for its use can be found in ["Deploying Lettuce"](/deployment).

The app runs a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) service.
Details of the API's endpoints can be found in [routers](/api_reference/routers).

All of the endpoints use settings detailed in the [PipelineOptions](/api_reference/options/pipeline_options#pipelineoptions) object.
