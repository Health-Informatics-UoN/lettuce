## Graphical User Interface
[source](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/lettuce/tree/main/Lettuce/ui.py)

Lettuce uses [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to provide a graphical user interface (GUI).
Once you have [a Lettuce API accepting requests](/deployment), you can start the GUI by running

```sh
poetry run streamlit run ui.py
```

In the /Lettuce directory.

This will open a new browser window.
The landing page provides a facility for entering informal names into a text box.
A second page, accessible from the sidebar, allows you to run Lettuce on informal names taken from a csv file.
