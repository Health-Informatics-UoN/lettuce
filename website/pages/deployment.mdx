# Deploying Lettuce

Lettuce provides a server for HTTP endpoints.
If you have successfully run the [quickstart](/quickstart) then you have the correct setup for running a Lettuce server.

<Callout>
  Making Lettuce easier to deploy is the next milestone for development, so watch this space!
</Callout>

The code for the server runs from [api.py](/api_reference/api)

```sh copy
uv run --env-file .env api.py
```

After running this command, you should see messages like these in your terminal:

```sh
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [73042] using StatReload
INFO:     Started server process [73353]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

This means that the server is running, and is able to accept HTTP requests.
A request can be made using e.g. curl

```sh copy
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/pipeline/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"names": ["Betnovate Scalp Application", "Panadol"]}'
```

## Endpoints

<Callout type="warning" emoji=" ">
  The endpoints will soon be re-arranged once the experimental pipelines have been stabilised. Consult the [routes documentation](/api_reference/routers).
</Callout>

The following endpoints will take HTTP `POST` requests:

- `/pipeline/`: generates a suggested formal name for a source term(s) and searches the OMOP-CDM for that suggestion
- `/pipeline/db`: searches the OMOP-CDM for a provided source term(s)
- `/pipeline/vector_search`: searches a vector database for concepts semantically similar to the provided source term(s)
- `/pipeline/vector_llm`: searches a vector database for concepts semantically similar to the source term(s) and uses these for retrieval-augmented generation with the LLM

## Request options

Requests to the API endpoints must have a body containing a list of informal names (`"names"`), and can optionally define options for the pipeline, ([`pipeline_options`](/api_reference/options/pipeline_options#pipelineoptions)).



Once you have the API accepting requests, you can use the [GUI](/api_reference/ui) to more easily make requests.
