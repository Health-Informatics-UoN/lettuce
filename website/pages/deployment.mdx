# Deploying Lettuce

Lettuce provides a server for HTTP endpoints.
If you have successfully run the [quickstart](/quickstart) then you have the correct setup for running a Lettuce server.

<Callout>
  Making Lettuce easier to deploy is the next milestone for development, so watch this space!
</Callout>

The code for the server runs from [api.py](/api_reference/api)

```sh copy
uv run lettuce-api
```

After running this command, you should see messages like these in your terminal:

```sh
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [73042] using StatReload
INFO:     Started server process [73353]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

This means that the server is running, and is able to accept HTTP requests.

Lettuce requires authentication, with the API key configured through the environment.
The easiest way to test the API is through a service like [postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a client like [bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/).
You will need to set up authentication by adding an API key with the key `Authorization`, and the value set in the environment as `AUTH_API_KEY`.

## Endpoints

The following endpoints will take HTTP `GET` requests:

- `/search/text-search/<source term>`: Runs full-text search for the source term
- `/search/vector-search/<source term>`: Runs semantic search for the source term
- `/search/ai-search/<source term>`: Runs retrieval-augmented generation search for the source term

## Request options
Pipeline options can be configured by appending them to the URL.
For more information, consult [the search routes documentation](/api_reference/routers/search_routes.mdx)
