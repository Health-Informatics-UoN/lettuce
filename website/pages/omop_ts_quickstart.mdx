# Database Setup for Lettuce
Lettuce requires a PostgreSQL database with the OMOP CDM (Common Data Model) schema, along with specific extensions for full-text search and vector similarity capabilities.

## Prerequisites 

### Required PostgreSQL Extensions 
- **Full-text search:** Built-in PostgreSQL capability for text searching
- **pgvector:** Extension for vector similarity searches 

### Required OMOP Tables
Lettuce expects the following tables from the OMOP CDM v5.0 vocabulary:
| Table              | Purpose                                            | Key Columns                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `concept`            | Core vocabulary table containing all medical concepts | `concept_id`, `concept_name`, `vocabulary_id`, `concept_code`, `standard_concept`     |
| `concept_synonym`    | Alternative names for concepts                    | `concept_id`, `concept_synonym_name`, `language_concept_id`                       |
| `concept_relationship` | Relationships between concepts                  | `concept_id_1`, `concept_id_2`, `relationship_id`, `valid_start_date`, `valid_end_date`|
| `concept_ancestor`   | Hierarchical relationships between concepts       | `ancestor_concept_id`, `descendant_concept_id`, `min_levels_of_separation`, `max_levels_of_separation` |

### Custom Table for Vector Search
To enable semantic similarity search, you'll need to generate vector embeddings for concepts using a supported model defined in `components.embeddings`.


<Callout type="info">
The dimensions of your embeddings must match the selected model:
- BGE-small: 384
- GTR-T5-base: 768
</Callout>


## Setup Options

You can use either an existing OMOP-compliant database, or set up a containerized instance for development and testing.

---

## Option 1: Using an Existing OMOP Database
If you already have access to a PostgreSQL instance with the required OMOP tables and extensions, you can proceed directly to [Next Steps](#next-steps).


## Option 2: Set Up a Containerized Database with `omop-ts`

Use the [`omop-lite`](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/omop-lite) repository to quickly spin up a local OMOP-compatible database.

<Steps>

### Clone the `omop-lite` repository 
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash 
git clone git@github.com:Health-Informatics-UoN/omop-lite.git
cd omop-lite
```


### Prepare Data Directory
Create a `data` directory at the root level of the repo: 
```bash
mkdir -p ./data
```
Copy your OMOP `.csv` files (e.g., `CONCEPT.csv`, `CONCEPT_SYNONYM.csv`) into this folder.

<Callout type='info'>
    For testing, minimal example files are provided in `omop_lite/synthetic`.
</Callout>


### Build and start the `omop-ts` docker container
Start the containerized OMOP database using Docker Compose:
```bash 
docker compose -f compose-omop-ts.yml up -d 
```
This will launch a PostgreSQL instance with the necessary schema and extensions pre-configured.


### Verify 
Verify that the database was properly populated by running the following command: 
```bash 
docker exec omop-ts-omop-ts-1 psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM cdm.concept LIMIT 5;"
```
You should see output showing the first 5 rows from the concept table, confirming the database is set up correctly.

</Steps>

## Next Steps 
Once your database is running, configure Lettuce to connect to it using the connection string and credentials defined in your `.env` file, as outlined in the Quickstart guide.
