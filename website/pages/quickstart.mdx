# Quickstart
The fastest way to get started with Lettuce is to use the [command-line interface (CLI)](/api_reference/cli).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) for dependency management
- Access to an OMOP-CDM database with a pgvector table for concept embeddings
- (Optional) An [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) server accepting connections

<Steps>

### Clone the [`lettuce`](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/lettuce/) repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/lettuce.git
cd lettuce
```

### Set Up Your Environment
Lettuce uses a `.env` file to manage database credentials.

Create a `.env` file with the following contents:

```sh copy
DB_HOST="your-db-host"
DB_USER="your-db-username"
DB_PASSWORD="your-db-password" 
DB_NAME="your-db-name"
DB_PORT="5432" # or your custom port
DB_SCHEMA="cdm"
DB_VECTABLE="embeddings"  # or your custom vector table
DB_VECSIZE="384" # or 768, depending on the embedding model
```
<Callout type='info'>
If you're using a containerised version, these values will differâ€”see the [Database Setup guide](/omop_ts_quickstart). 
</Callout>

### Install dependencies
Dependencies are handled with uv, and first have to be installed from the `pyproject.toml` via: 
```bash
uv sync
```

This will install the dependencies for running Lettuce with the LLM running in an Ollama server.
For this to work, you'll have to have an Ollama server running, and make requests to a model that you have previously pulled to Ollama.
For example, if you specify `LLM_MODEL="gemma3n:e4b"` in lettuce, you will need to have previously run

```bash
ollama pull gemma3n:e4b
```

Lettuce can also be run without Ollama, instead using [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) for inference.

<Callout type='warning'>
Llama.cpp installation can be tricky, particularly on Windows
</Callout>

The dependencies for running inference in Llama.cpp are installed using the `--extra` flag, e.g.

```bash
uv sync --extra llama-cpp
```

This will try to build Llama.cpp on your machine.
There are a few pitfalls here.
On Windows, you will need to have Visual Code set up correctly.
On Apple silicon, this seems fairly bulletproof, but on other operating systems we have also had issues with the installation not correctly recognising GPUs.
Workarounds can be found on the [Llama.cpp repository](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp).
These seem to change fairly often, so caveat developer!

As an alternative, we provide the option of using precompiled wheels as dependencies.

| Extra name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `llama-cpp` | Builds from source |
| `llama-cpu` | Pre-compiled wheel with basic CPU support |
| `llama-gpu-metal` | Pre-compiled wheel with Apple silicon support |
| `llama-gpu-cu121` | Pre-compiled wheel for CUDA 12.1 |
| `llama-gpu-cu122` | Pre-compiled wheel for CUDA 12.2 |
| `llama-gpu-cu123` | Pre-compiled wheel for CUDA 12.3 |
| `llama-gpu-cu124` | Pre-compiled wheel for CUDA 12.4 |

### Run the CLI


Once this is complete, you can run `lettuce-cli`

```sh
uv run lettuce-cli --no-use_llm --no-vector_search "acetaminophen" 
```

The flags in this command disable the vector search and LLM, just querying the database for "acetaminophen".
Running the LLM will download a model, and vector search use the embeddings table to perform and semantic search on the search term, so these flags can be omitted when you're ready to take these steps.
