# Quickstart
The fastest way to get started with Lettuce is to use the [command-line interface (CLI)](/api_reference/cli).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- uv[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/]
- Access to an OMOP-CDM database with a pgvector table for concept embeddings

<Steps>
#### Clone the [Lettuce repo](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/lettuce/)

#### Navigate to the /Lettuce directory

### Configure database connection
The Lettuce CLI connects to an OMOP-CDM database as configured through environment variables. 
The [database connection](/api_reference/omop/OMOP_match) loads your credentials from a `.env` file. {/*This will change when we have a working compose*/}

##### Create a `.env` file

##### Insert database credentials
You will need the following information for your OMOP-CDM database:

```sh copy
DB_HOST="Your Host"
DB_USER="Your User"
DB_PASSWORD="Your Password"
DB_NAME="Your Database Name"
DB_PORT="Your Port, default is 5432"
DB_SCHEMA="Your Schema"
DB_VECTABLE="The name of your table containing vectors"
DB_VECSIZE="The length of vectors in your vector table"
```

Copy this template and insert your credentials.

#### Run the CLI

##### Install dependencies
Dependencies are handled with uv, and first have to be installed

```sh
uv sync
```

Once this is complete, you can run `lettuce-cli`

```sh
uv run --env-file .env lettuce-cli --informal_names "acetaminophen" --no-use_llm --no-vector_search
```

The flags in this command disable the vector search and LLM, just querying the database for "acetaminophen".
Running the LLM will download a model, and vector search will first build a vector database, so these flags can be omitted when you're ready to take these steps
