# Quickstart
The fastest way to get started with Lettuce is to use the [command-line interface (CLI)](/api_reference/cli).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) for dependency management
- Access to an OMOP-CDM database with a pgvector table for concept embeddings

<Steps>

### Clone the [`lettuce`](https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/lettuce/) repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Health-Informatics-UoN/lettuce.git
cd lettuce
```

### Set Up Your Environment
Lettuce uses a `.env` file to manage database credentials.

Create a `.env` file with the following contents:

```sh copy
DB_HOST="your-db-host"
DB_USER="your-db-username"
DB_PASSWORD="your-db-password" 
DB_NAME="your-db-name"
DB_PORT="5432" # or your custom port
DB_SCHEMA="cdm"
DB_VECTABLE="embeddings"  # or your custom vector table
DB_VECSIZE="384" # or 768, depending on the embedding model
```
<Callout type='info'>
If you're using a containerised version, these values will differâ€”see the [Database Setup guide](/omop_ts_quickstart). 
</Callout>

### Install dependencies
Dependencies are handled with uv, and first have to be installed from the `pyproject.toml` via: 
```bash
uv sync
```

### Run the CLI


Once this is complete, you can run `lettuce-cli`

```sh
uv run --env-file .env lettuce-cli --informal_names "acetaminophen" --no-use_llm --no-vector_search
```

The flags in this command disable the vector search and LLM, just querying the database for "acetaminophen".
Running the LLM will download a model, and vector search use the embeddings table to perform and semantic search on the search term, so these flags can be omitted when you're ready to take these steps.
